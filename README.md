# Job Posting + AI
In this project, we are developing an innovative software solution aimed at automating the creation of social media posts for job vacancies. The main objective of the system is to optimize the promotion of job openings on social media platforms, ensuring the posts are effective in attracting the right candidates while also enhancing the employer's brand. The system integrates AI to generate posts, offers pre-designed templates, and supports API integration with social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.
